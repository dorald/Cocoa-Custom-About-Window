Demonstrates how to customize the standard "About <app name>..." window for Cocoa applications.

###Background

In the code generated by all Xcode templates, when you select "About <app name>..." in an app's main menu, 
the method:

    - (void)orderFrontStandardAboutPanelWithOptions:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)optionsDictionary

is called on the shared application object, which in turn presents a small window with standard
labels and an icon displaying info about your app, which is exctracted from certain keys in the 
property list (version, copyright, etc.).

However, it would be very difficult to obtain a reference to this window and customize it at runtime. 
The best you are allowed to do is drop a custom `Credits.rtf` file in your resources folder and have
the default _About..._ window pick that up at runtime.

###Features

This project demonstrates how to use a custom window controller and present that instead.
It reads from `Info.plist` all the same keys that the default _About..._ window shows.
But in contrast with the default windwo,because you have access to the window controller's source 
code, you can customize its appearance, add extra labels, etc. In this demo, I have changed the
appearance of the window to "Vibrant Dark", much like e.g., the [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com) app.
